# w32api is a set of cffi wrappers for Win32 API.

## TODOs 
- Fix the broken tests in latest win10/sbcl.
- Try using some CI services to expand machine/implementation coverages. Beg for free public Windows machines.
- Refactor user level APIs with OOP(CLOS). 
- Doc, Doc, Doc...

**This project was planned for making a thin trampoline between Win32 natives and McClim. **
**If you want to try it with McClim, please use [this](https://github.com/onixie/mcclim-old) - a fork from an older version of McClim.**
